% LMS Type Directed partial evaluation

 Programming languages Idris~\cite{brady2010scrapping} and D~\cite{dlang} try to solve this problem by allowing
  the \code{static} annotation on function arguments. Annotation \code{static} denotes
  that the term is statically known and that all operations on that term should
  be executed at compile-time. However, since \code{static} is placed on terms rather
  then types, it can mark only \emph{whole terms} as static. This restricts the number
  of programs that can be expressed, \eg, we could not express that vectors in the
  signature of \emph{dot} are static only in size. Finally, information about \code{static}
  terms can not be deterministically propagated through return types of functions so \code{static}
  in Idris and D is a partial evaluation construct.
