\section{Conclusion}
\label{sct:conclusion}

\tool is only the first step towards a staging system for Scala that is fully integrated in the language. For
 complete integration it would be necessery to allow usage of \code{ct} on trait and class definitions
 as well as abstract types.

In \tool annotation of a term determins the stage where it is computed. When \tool is used only for partial evaluation
 this can lead to unnecessary code duplication as users need to provide two versions of the same
 code (one staged and one unstaged). For a practical system it is necessary to extend \tool with
 annotations which denote that terms should be partially evaluated if they are statically known.
 We have achieved this for variable argument funcitons in \sct{sct:varargs} with an ad-hoc mechanism,
 however, we seek for a principled solution.
